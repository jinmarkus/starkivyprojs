# starkivyprojs
# so basically..
# 	figured out how to update current directory and how to (push?) it to git
#	
#	essentially you want to:
#	
#		git add .
#	
#	this will add everything in your current directory to your git repository (local)
#	then you can check the resulting status of the add by:
#	
#		git status
# 	
#	this will tell you the status of your updates
#	then you can update commit your changes using:
#	
#		git commit -m "your commit comment here"
#	
#	then once you have your commit finished you can update it to the final repository
#	on git:
#
#		git push origin master
